# **Protocol Overview**

Hotline client is an application executing on the user’s computer, and providing user interface for end-user services (chat, messaging, file services and other). Hotline server provides services and facilitates communication between all clients that are currently connected to it. Tracker application stores the list of servers that register with it, and provides that list to clients that request it. All these applications use TCP/IP for communication.

To be able to connect to the specific server, IP address and port number must be provided to the client application. If client receives server’s address from a tracker, the tracker will provide the client with complete address. Otherwise, the user of Hotline client software must manually set this address. IP port number, set in the Hotline client for a specific server, is called _base port number_. Additional port numbers utilized by the network protocol are determined by using this base port number. Namely, the base port number itself is used for regular transactions, while base port \+ 1 is used when upload/download is requested. HTTP tunneling uses base port \+ 2 for the regular transactions, and base \+ 3 for uploads/downloads.

Numeric data transmitted over the wire is always in the network byte order.

# **Session Initialization**

After establishing TCP connection, both client and server start the handshake process in order to confirm that each of them comply with requirements of the other. The information provided in this initial data exchange identifies protocols, and their versions, used in the communication. In the case where, after inspection, the capabilities of one of the subjects do not comply with the requirements of the other, the connection is dropped. The following information is sent to the server:

| Description     | Size |  Data  | Note         |
| :-------------- | ---: | :----: | :----------- |
| Protocol ID     |    4 | ‘TRTP’ | 0x54525450   |
| Sub-protocol ID |    4 |        | User defined |
| Version         |    2 |   1    | Currently 1  |
| Sub-version     |    2 |        | User defined |

The server replies with the following:

| Description | Size |  Data  | Note                                              |
| :---------- | ---: | :----: | :------------------------------------------------ |
| Protocol ID |    4 | ‘TRTP’ |                                                   |
| Error code  |    4 |        | Error code returned by the server (0 \= no error) |

In the case of an error, client and server close the connection.

# **Transactions**

After the initial handshake, client and server communicate over the connection by sending and receiving _transactions_. Every transaction contains description (request) and/or status (reply) of the operation that is performed, and parameters used for that specific operation. A transaction begins with the following header:

| Description | Size |  Data  | Note                                                                                              |
| :---------- | ---: | :----: | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Flags       |    1 |   0    | Reserved (should be 0\)                                                                           |
| Is reply    |    1 | 0 or 1 | Request (0) or reply (1)                                                                          |
| Type        |    2 |        | Requested operation (user defined)                                                                |
| ID          |    4 | Not 0  | Unique transaction ID (must be \!= 0\)                                                            |
| Error code  |    4 |        | Used in the reply (user defined, 0 \= no error)                                                   |
| Total size  |    4 |        | Total data size for the transaction (all parts)                                                   |
| Data size   |    4 |        | Size of data in this transaction part This allows splitting large transactions into smaller parts |

Immediately following the header is optional transaction data. Data part contains _transaction parameters_. When these parameters are used, data part starts with the field containing the number of parameters in the parameter list:

| Description          | Size | Data | Note                                          |
| :------------------- | ---: | :--: | :-------------------------------------------- |
| Number of parameters |    2 |      | Number of the parameters for this transaction |
| Parameter list…      |      |      |                                               |

Parameter list contains multiple records with the following structure:

| Description | Size | Data | Note                  |
| :---------- | ---: | :--: | :-------------------- |
| Field ID    |    2 |      |                       |
| Field size  |    2 |      | Size of the data part |
| Field data… | size |      | Actual field content  |

Every field data format is based on the field type. Currently, there are only 3 predefined field data types: integer, string and binary.

# **Transaction Fields**

There are 3 predefined field data types: integer, string and binary. If field data does not fit in the first two categories, it is sent as binary data and interpreted by the receiving machine. Some of the binary fields are currently used as strings. All integer fields are treated as unsigned, and can be sent as 16 or 32-bit numbers. This is determined by evaluation of the number itself. Namely, if integer can be represented using only 2 bytes, it is sent as such. In the case when the number is greater than 2^16, it’s sent as 32-bit number. String fields currently use 8-bit ASCII character set.

# **Download Folder Actions**

These values are used to control folder upload/download process. When an application receives folder upload request, it is presented with the first applicable file. In the reply, application will specify an action to be performed:

**Send File (1)**
Constant: dlFldrAction\_SendFile

Send file action starts the download of the file specified in the request. An additional TCP connection is opened to transfer this file, according to the protocol described in Download Folder (210) and Upload Folder (213) transaction.

**Resume File Download (2)**
Constant: dlFldrAction\_ResumeFile

This action is similar to the send file action. It also starts the download, while providing the starting position in the file. An additional TCP connection is opened to transfer this file, in the same manner as for send file action.

**Next File (3)**
Constant: dlFldrAction\_NextFile

Next file action notifies the receiver to send the name of the next file in a folder. Download of the current file in not initiated.
**Transaction Sequences**

Hotline client contains few predefined transaction sequences in its current implementation. These sequences are described in this section.

## **Login**

After sending Login transaction (107), server will reply with Show Agreement (109). If user accepts the agreement, Hotline client sends Agreed transaction (121), followed by Get User Name List (300). Next, a Get File Name List (200) or Get News Category Name List (370) transaction is sent, depending on user preferences.

If server version is \< 151, server will not send Show Agreement reply. In this case, after Login (107) transaction is sent, client sends Set Client User Info (304) transaction with only User Name (102) and User Icon ID (104) fields used, and does not expect a reply. Subsequently, it sends Get User Name List (300) request, followed by Get File Name List (200) or Get News Category Name List (370), depending on user preferences. After that, a banner is requested from HTTP server.

## **Invite To Chat**

When client receives Invite To Chat (113) transaction from the sever with version \< 151, and client has automatic response or reject chat flag set, Reject Chat Invite (114) transaction is sent back to the server.

# **Tracker Interface**

All string values use 8-bit ASCII character set encoding.

## **Client Interface with Tracker**

After establishing a connection with tracker, the following information is sent:

| Description  | Size |  Data  | Note                        |
| :----------- | ---: | :----: | :-------------------------- |
| Magic number |    4 | ‘HTRK’ |                             |
| Version      |    2 | 1 or 2 | Old protocol (1) or new (2) |

When version number is 2, request also includes additional data:

| Description   | Size |  Data  | Note                             |
| :------------ | ---: | :----: | :------------------------------- |
| Login size    |    1 | \>= 31 | Login string size                |
| Login         | size |        | Login string (padded with 0\)    |
| Password size |    1 | \>= 31 | Password string size             |
| Password      | size |        | Password string (padded with 0\) |

Reply received from the tracker starts with a header:

| Description  | Size |  Data  | Note                        |
| :----------- | ---: | :----: | :-------------------------- |
| Magic number |    4 | ‘HTRK’ | 0x4854524B                  |
| Version      |    2 | 1 or 2 | Old protocol (1) or new (2) |

Server information header follows, formatted as:

| Description       | Size | Data | Note                                 |
| :---------------- | ---: | :--: | :----------------------------------- |
| Message type      |    2 |  1   | Sending list of servers              |
| Message data size |    2 |      | Remaining size of this request       |
| Number of servers |    2 |      | Number of servers in the server list |
| Number of servers |    2 |      | Same as previous field               |
| Server list…      |      |      |                                      |

A record in the server list has the following structure:

| Description      | Size | Data | Note                                                |
| :--------------- | ---: | :--: | :-------------------------------------------------- |
| IP address       |    4 |      | Server’s IP address                                 |
| IP port number   |    2 |      | Server’s IP port number                             |
| Number of users  |    2 |      | Number of users connected to this particular server |
|                  |    2 |  0   |                                                     |
| Name size        |    1 |      | Server’s name string size                           |
| Name             | size |      | Server’s name                                       |
| Description size |    1 |      | Server’s description string size                    |
| Description      | size |      | Description of the server                           |

If the number of servers in the server list is less than number of servers specified in the server information header, client will expect an additional server information, starting with the new server information header. The field containing number of servers in the new header should have the same value as the previous one.

When a client is connected to the tracker over the HTTP tunneling protocol, the client does not send any request to the tracker, although it still expects a properly formatted reply. In this case establishing a connection to the tracker indicates a request for the server list.

## **Server Interface with Tracker**

Server sets up UDP port that is used to periodically send the following information to the trackers:

| Description      | Size | Data | Note                                                |
| :--------------- | ---: | :--: | :-------------------------------------------------- |
|                  |    2 |  1   |                                                     |
| IP port number   |    2 |      | Server’s listening UDP port number                  |
| Number of users  |    2 |      | Number of users connected to this particular server |
|                  |    2 |  0   |                                                     |
| Pass ID          |    4 |      | Random number generated by the server               |
| Name size        |    1 |      | Server’s name string size                           |
| Name             | size |      | Server’s name                                       |
| Description size |    1 |      | Server’s description string size                    |
| Description      | size |      | Description of the server                           |

In the case when old (?) tracker is used, the additional information is formatted as follows:

| Description   | Size | Data | Note                                  |
| :------------ | ---: | :--: | :------------------------------------ |
| Password size |    1 |      | Server’s tracker password string size |
| Password      | size |      | Server’s tracker password             |

For a new version of the tracker:

| Description   | Size | Data | Note                                  |
| :------------ | ---: | :--: | :------------------------------------ |
| Login size    |    1 |      | Server’s tracker login string size    |
| Login         | size |      | Server’s tracker login                |
| Password size |    1 |      | Server’s tracker password string size |
| Password      | size |      | Server’s tracker password             |

**HTTP Tunneling**

When client is unable to communicate with the server using plain TCP connection, HTTP tunneling can be utilized to access the Hotline server over an HTTP proxy. To accomplish this, the client creates two connections to the server. One would be used for sending, and other for receiving data. After these connections are open, the client begins transmitting standard HTTP requests. If HTTP proxy terminates connection while that connection is still in use, the client recreates them, and interrupted requests are resent.

## **HTTP Requests**

HTTP POST request is sent over sending, while GET request is sent over receiving connection. The POST request is specified as follows:

POST \<address\> HTTP/1.0\\r\\n
Proxy-Connection: Keep-Alive\\r\\n
Pragma: no-cache\\r\\n
Host: \<host\>\\r\\n
Content-Length: 999999999\\r\\n
Content-Type: hotline/protocol\\r\\n
\\r\\n

The server replies to this request at the time when connection is about to be closed, as:

HTTP/1.0 302 Found\\r\\n
Connection: close\\r\\n
Content-Length: 8\\r\\n
Content-Type: hotline/protocol\\r\\n
\\r\\n

Next 8 bytes are filled with 0 to indicate termination of a connection.

GET request is specified as:

GET \<address\> HTTP/1.0\\r\\n
Proxy-Connection: Keep-Alive\\r\\n
Pragma: no-cache\\r\\n
Host: \<host\>\\r\\n
Accept: hotline/protocol\\r\\n
\\r\\n

Server’s immediate reply to GET is:

HTTP/1.0 200 OK\\r\\n
Proxy-Connection: Keep-Alive\\r\\n
Content-Length: 999999999\\r\\n
Content-Type: hotline/protocol\\r\\n
\\r\\n

After this reply, server uses this connection to send data to the client.

Address used in these requests is standard URL address followed by the session ID, specified as the file in the root directory. This is an example of such address:

http://tracker.com:5497/5555-5555-5555

Session ID is used in order to identify the client in the case of disconnect. Host name specified in the HTTP headers is in the form of standard domain name string, followed by the port number. For example:

tracker.com:5497

## **Data Header**

Additional header precedes every transaction that is sent over these two connections. This header has the format:

| Description | Size | Data | Note                                  |
| :---------- | ---: | :--: | :------------------------------------ |
| Data code   |    4 |      | Disconnect (0), data (1), padding (2) |
| Data size   |    4 |      |                                       |
| Data…       | size |      |                                       |

Data content depends on the data code specified. If data code value is 1 (constant is http\_Data), data content is transaction data as described in this specification (this includes tracker protocol). Code and size with value 0 (hard-coded constant) notifies the remote end of a pending disconnect.

After predetermined period of inactivity on an HTTP connection, the proxy server can close that link in order to preserve its resources. To prevent this, additional “padding” data is transmitted, only to keep this connection “alive”. Data code value 2 (http\_Padding) indicates that this is the case. When remote end receives this packet type, its data content is simply discarded.
**Global Server**

**1.1 Server Information**

Hotline servers will be able to create an account on the global server by providing a unique _server name_ (relatively short in size) and an _access password_. This information constitutes an account login information that will have to be provided in every subsequent access to the global server. At the time the account is created, the global server assigns the unique _server ID_ to the server.

Global server will provide servers with the ability to store a predefined set of data fields. In addition to the name, the server can also provide region specific _server alias_. _Description_ field can be used to describe the server’s content to users. Servers can also be optionally classified into one of the few predefined categories provided by the global server. This will allow users to determine server’s content based on a common _classification_ scheme. An optional _public encryption key_ can be used to authenticate the server to the users that are connecting to it. Global server will also record server’s _original and current_ (last used) _IP address_.

_Server flags_ enable or disable various operations that global server performs. _Searchable flag_ signals if the server will be included as part of the results of the user’s query. _Rating_ field enables users to rate the server.

_Server status_ describes the current availability of server’s services. _On-line status_ indicates that server is currently operational and ready to process requests. _Active status_ shows that server’s account is active, even if the server is not currently on-line. Removing active status indicates that the server can’t be made operational in the short term. This can be used when the server is about to go through a non-trivial maintenance process. The server can also specify the _number of users_ currently connected to it. Global server records _date_ when account was _created_ and _accessed_.

The following table summarizes the server information stored on the global server:

| Data                  | Options                     | Note                              |
| :-------------------- | :-------------------------- | :-------------------------------- |
| Server ID             |                             | Assigned by the global server     |
| Server name           |                             | Used as login                     |
| Access password       |                             |                                   |
